> ðŸš§ **Project and Documentation Under Construction** ðŸš§

### Introduction

Welcome to RCIoTs, my personal playground where I explore and experiment with Proof of Concepts (POCs) focused on Edge Computing, IoT, robotics, and other fascinating technologies that catch my interest. This space serves as a laboratory for testing and developing innovative solutions that bridge the gap between physical hardware and cloud computing.

The projects in RCIoTs are primarily built using JavaScript, leveraging WebSockets for real-time communication between edge devices, cloud services, and web browsers. I combine this software foundation with 3D printing for hardware prototyping and microcontroller-based electronics that interface with the Edge devices. While these are experimental projects, I ground them in enterprise-grade open source tools from Red Hat to demonstrate how such solutions could scale in production environments using technologies like Red Hat Device Edge, Microshift, FlightCTL, and OpenShift.

### Project Evolution

The RCIoTs ecosystem has evolved through several iterations, with some projects being archived as they served their purpose or were superseded by more advanced implementations:

**RCIoTs PaaS**: This was an early proof of concept for centralized edge application management. While it demonstrated the potential for such a system, I decided to archive it when I began collaborating with FlightCTL, as their solution provided a more robust and production-ready approach to edge management.

**Claw Machine**: A cloud-controlled arcade claw machine that featured real-time video streaming. This project was particularly fun to develop and served as a great learning experience. You can see it in action in this [demonstration video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNUvxOK2avE).

## Marble Maze

```

The system architecture is built around several key components that work together to create a seamless gaming experience. At the heart of the system is the MM-Socket-Manager, which coordinates all communication between the various components. The MM-WS-Connector serves as the bridge between the hardware controllers (steppers, Arduino, and camera) and the cloud service MM-Socket-Manager. It establishes a secure WebSocket connection with mTLS to the MM-Socket-Manager while maintaining local WebSocket connections with the hardware controllers, routing messages between them.

The hardware layer consists of multiple specialized components:
- A Makerbase E3D controller managing the stepper motors
- An Arduino Mega handling sensor data, servo motors and LED control
- A webcam providing real-time video feed of the game

Each of these components communicates through dedicated controllers that translate high-level commands into specific hardware instructions.

### Core Services

The Marble Maze system is built on a foundation of specialized services, each handling specific aspects of the game's operation. These services are designed to work together seamlessly while maintaining clear separation of concerns.

#### MM-Front
The web-based user interface serves as the primary interaction point for players. The frontend is built with React and served through an Express.js server, which provides a WebSocket endpoint using Socket.IO for real-time communication between user browsers and the MM-Socket-Manager backend service. This architecture enables seamless bidirectional communication while simultaneously handling video streaming integration directly within the web interface.

The interface is designed to be intuitive and responsive, with particular attention to:
- Real-time game state visualization
- Seamless video stream integration
- Intuitive control mechanisms
- Dynamic game state display

#### MM-Socket-Manager
The MM-Socket-Manager serves as the critical interconnection point between the Edge device and the frontend service. It establishes a secure WebSocket connection with mTLS authentication to the Edge device, while simultaneously maintaining the connection with MM-Front. This architecture ensures secure and reliable communication between the physical hardware and the web interface, handling the routing of commands and state updates between both ends of the system.

Key responsibilities include:
- Secure WebSocket connection management with mTLS
- Message routing between Edge device and frontend
- Connection state monitoring and recovery
- Real-time data transmission
- Error handling and logging
- Connection authentication and authorization
- Message validation and sanitization
- Connection pool management

#### MM-WS-Connector
The WebSocket Connector serves as the communication bridge between the hardware controllers (steppers, Arduino, and camera) and the cloud service MM-Socket-Manager. It establishes a secure WebSocket connection with mTLS to the MM-Socket-Manager while maintaining local WebSocket connections with the hardware controllers, routing messages between them.

The connector's architecture is designed to be:
- Reliable: With automatic reconnection and error recovery
- Secure: Using mTLS for cloud communications while maintaining local WebSocket connections
- Efficient: Optimizing message delivery and resource usage
- Scalable: Supporting multiple concurrent connections

#### Hardware Controllers
The system includes specialized controllers for different hardware components:

**MM-Controller-Steppers**: Manages the precise movement of the game's mechanical components through G-code generation and motor control. It sends G-codes to the Marlin firmware deployed on the Makerbase board, maintaining precise position tracking and implementing movement algorithms to ensure smooth and accurate operation.

**MM-Controller-Arduino**: Handles the game's sensor network, servo motors, and LED system, processing sensor data and controlling both servo movements and visual feedback. It implements bidirectional Serial communication between the Node.js controller service and the Arduino's C++ firmware, enabling reliable hardware interaction.

**MM-CAM**: Captures video from the webcam and forwards the streaming via WebSocket to the MM-WS-Connector. The service uses FFmpeg for efficient video processing and implements adaptive quality control to ensure optimal viewing experience.

### Edge Computing Implementation

The Marble Maze project leverages Node.js and Socket.IO as core technologies for its edge computing implementation. This choice was driven by several key factors that make these technologies particularly well-suited for edge computing scenarios.

Node.js provides an ideal foundation for edge computing applications through its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. This architecture is particularly valuable in edge environments where resources are often constrained and efficient handling of multiple concurrent operations is crucial. The platform's ability to handle numerous simultaneous connections without blocking the main thread makes it perfect for real-time applications like Marble Maze, where we need to manage multiple hardware interfaces, sensor data streams, and user connections simultaneously.

The event-driven nature of Node.js aligns perfectly with the requirements of edge computing. Each component of our system - from motor control to sensor data collection - operates asynchronously, allowing the application to maintain responsiveness even under heavy load. This is particularly important when dealing with hardware interfaces, where timing and responsiveness are critical for precise control of mechanical components.

Socket.IO enhances our edge computing capabilities by providing a robust, bidirectional communication layer. The library's ability to automatically handle connection issues and provide fallback mechanisms is invaluable in edge environments where network conditions can be unpredictable. In Marble Maze, this translates to reliable real-time communication between the game interface, hardware controllers, and all involved services.

One of the most significant advantages of using Socket.IO in our edge implementation is its adaptive protocol system. When WebSocket connections are available, it provides optimal performance with full-duplex communication. However, when network conditions are less than ideal, it gracefully falls back to alternative transport methods, ensuring continuous operation of the system. This reliability is crucial for maintaining the real-time nature of the game while ensuring a smooth user experience.

Node.js and Socket.IO together provide a robust platform for our edge computing needs. The system manages hardware components through serial and USB connections locally, while maintaining WebSocket communications with cloud services. Node.js's event-driven I/O system efficiently handles both local hardware interactions and network communications, enabling precise control of mechanical components alongside real-time user interactions.

In the context of Marble Maze, this technology stack enables several critical features:

Real-time control of the game's mechanical components is achieved through low-latency communication channels. Motor movements, sensor readings, and LED control signals are transmitted with minimal delay, ensuring precise and responsive gameplay. The system maintains a consistent state across all components, synchronizing the physical game state with the digital interface in real-time.

Video streaming is implemented as a one-way flow from the edge device to the cloud, where the frontend service receives the stream and broadcasts it to all connected users. This architecture ensures efficient bandwidth usage at the edge while enabling multiple users to view the game state simultaneously through the frontend's broadcast capabilities.

Session management is implemented with a focus on reliability and user experience. The system handles multiple concurrent players, manages game turns, and maintains synchronized state across all connected clients. When network issues occur, the system implements graceful degradation and recovery mechanisms to ensure a smooth gaming experience.

Monitoring and diagnostics are integral parts of the system. Real-time metrics collection provides insights into system performance, while remote logging capabilities enable quick identification and resolution of issues. The system maintains comprehensive state information about all components, allowing for proactive maintenance and troubleshooting.

The security aspects of our edge computing implementation are particularly important. The system implements robust authentication mechanisms and encrypts communications using TLS/SSL.

This technology stack has proven particularly effective for Marble Maze's requirements, providing the necessary performance, reliability, and flexibility for a complex edge computing application. The combination of Node.js's efficient resource utilization and Socket.IO's robust communication capabilities creates a solid foundation for real-time, interactive and b edge applications.

### Deployment and Infrastructure
